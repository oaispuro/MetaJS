# MetaJS
This Repository showcases my progress as a Fron-End developer through the Coursera Programming with JavaScript course.
It presents my progression in the programming language JavaScript through the exercises in the course.
These exercises developed my knowledge of basic concepts as declaring variable up to working on the Final Project of 
writing functions to calculate amounts to pay and logs out the results.
